# Security Features Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the security features implemented in the portfolio website to ensure data protection, prevent common web vulnerabilities, and enhance overall application security.

## Implemented Security Features

### 1. Security Headers
The application implements comprehensive security headers to protect against various attacks:

- **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Restricts which resources can be loaded, preventing XSS attacks
- **X-Content-Type-Options**: Prevents MIME type sniffing
- **X-Frame-Options**: Protects against clickjacking attacks
- **X-XSS-Protection**: Enables browser's built-in XSS protection
- **Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)**: Forces HTTPS connections
- **Referrer-Policy**: Controls information sent in the Referer header
- **Permissions-Policy**: Restricts which browser features can be used

### 2. CSRF Protection
Implemented Cross-Site Request Forgery protection using Flask-WTF:

- CSRF tokens are automatically added to forms
- Requests without valid CSRF tokens are rejected
- Custom error handling for CSRF validation failures

### 3. Rate Limiting
Protects against brute force and DoS attacks:

- Limits the number of requests from a single IP address
- Configurable request limits and time windows
- Custom rate limiting implementation using IP tracking

### 4. reCAPTCHA Integration
Protects forms from spam and abuse:

- Google reCAPTCHA v3 integration (invisible to users)
- Score-based bot detection
- Server-side verification of reCAPTCHA tokens

### 5. Input Validation & Sanitization
Prevents injection attacks:

- Server-side validation of all form inputs
- Email format validation using regex
- HTML entity encoding to prevent XSS
- Client-side validation for immediate feedback

### 6. Secure Cookie Configuration
Protects session data:

- HttpOnly flag prevents JavaScript access to cookies
- Secure flag ensures cookies are only sent over HTTPS
- SameSite attribute prevents CSRF attacks

### 7. Proxy Handling
Ensures correct IP detection behind proxies:

- ProxyFix middleware correctly handles X-Forwarded-For headers
- Prevents IP spoofing in proxy environments

## Security Best Practices

### For Production Deployment

1. **Environment Variables**:
   - Store sensitive values like SECRET_KEY and API keys as environment variables
   - Never commit secrets to version control

2. **HTTPS**:
   - Always use HTTPS in production
   - Configure proper SSL/TLS settings
   - Consider using Let's Encrypt for free certificates

3. **Regular Updates**:
   - Keep all dependencies updated
   - Monitor for security advisories

4. **Logging and Monitoring**:
   - Implement comprehensive logging
   - Set up alerts for suspicious activities
   - Regularly review logs

5. **Database Security** (when implemented):
   - Use parameterized queries
   - Implement least privilege principle
   - Encrypt sensitive data
